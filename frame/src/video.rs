/// YCbCr (NV12)
///
/// YCbCr, Y′CbCr, or Y Pb/Cb Pr/Cr, also written as YCBCR or Y′CBCR, is a
/// family of color spaces used as a part of the color image pipeline in video
/// and digital photography systems. Y′ is the luma component and CB and CR are
/// the blue-difference and red-difference chroma components. Y′ (with prime) is
/// distinguished from Y, which is luminance, meaning that light intensity is
/// nonlinearly encoded based on gamma corrected RGB primaries.
///
/// Y′CbCr color spaces are defined by a mathematical coordinate transformation
/// from an associated RGB primaries and white point. If the underlying RGB
/// color space is absolute, the Y′CbCr color space is an absolute color space
/// as well; conversely, if the RGB space is ill-defined, so is Y′CbCr. The
/// transformation is defined in equations 32, 33 in ITU-T H.273. Nevertheless
/// that rule does not apply to P3-D65 primaries used by Netflix with
/// BT.2020-NCL matrix, so that means matrix was not derived from primaries, but
/// now Netflix allows BT.2020 primaries (since 2021). The same happens with
/// JPEG: it has BT.601 matrix derived from System M primaries, yet the
/// primaries of most images are BT.709.
